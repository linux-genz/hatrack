 *  Name:           testhat.c
 *  Description:    A wrapper to provide a single interface to all
 *                  the implementations, for ease of testing.
 *
 *                  Note that this interface isn't particularly high
 *                  level:
 *
 *                  1) You need to do the hashing yourself, and pass in
 *                     the value.
 *
 *                  2) You just pass in a pointer to an "item" that's
 *                     expected to represent the key/item pair.
 *
 *                  3) You need to do your own memory management for
 *                     the key / item pairs, if appropriate.
 *
 *                  Most of the implementation is inlined in the header
 *                  file, since it merely dispatches to individual
 *                  implementations.
