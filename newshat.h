 *  Description:    Now Everyone Writes Simultaneously (HAsh Table)
 *
 *                  Uses pthread locks on a per-bucket basis, and
 *                  allows multiple simultaneous writers, except when
 *                  performing table migration.

/* newshat_record_t
 *
 * Each newshat bucket is individually locked, so that only one thread
 * can be writing to the bucket at a time. However, there may be
 * multiple readers in parallel. The things a reader might need should
 * be updated atomically, and are stored in newshat_record_t.
 *
 * item -- The item passed to the hash table, usually a key : value
 *         pair of some sort.
 *
 * info -- If the field is 0, then it indicates a deleted item.
 *         Otherwise, it represents the "epoch"-- an indication of the
 *         creation time of the item, relative to other items. Note
 *         that, since this table does not provide fully consistent
 *         views, the epoch is not quite as accurate as with other
 *         table implementations in the hatrack. In particular, bumps
 *         to the newshat_t data structure's next_epoch value (see
 *         below), are racy, so multiple data items can definitely get
 *         the same epoch value, meaning we have no linearization
 *         point on which to construct a consistent sort order.
