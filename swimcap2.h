 *  Name:           swimcap2.h
 *  Description:    Single WrIter, Multiple-read, Crappy, Albeit Parallel, v2.
 *
 *                  This uses a per-data structure lock that writers hold
 *                  for their entire operation.
 *
 *                  In this version, readers do NOT use the lock;
 *                  in fact, they are fully wait free.
 *
 *                  Instead, we use an epoch-based memory management
 *                  scheme on our current data store, to make sure that
 *                  a store cannot be deleted while we are reading it,
 *                  even if a resize has completed.
