// This API requires that you deal with hashing the key external to
// the API.  You might want to cache hash values, use different
// functions for different data objects, etc.
//
// We do require 128-bit hash values, and require that the hash value
// alone can stand in for object identity. One might, for instance,
// choose a 3-universal keyed hash function, or if hash values need to
// be consistent across runs, something fast and practical like XXH3.
