# Examples

This directory contains the following examples for developers:

1) *basic* - A simple example of creating two dictionaries, from argv
   and envp.

2) *set1* - Shows off how to use the hatrack_set class for set operations.

3) *hashable* - Shows off a more complex use case, with a higher-level
object type, caching of hash values, etc.

That's... currently it.  More to come.
