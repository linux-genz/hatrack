 *  Name:           swimcap.h
 *  Description:    Single WrIter, Multiple-read, Crappy, Albeit Parallel.
 *
 *                  This uses a per-data structure lock that writers hold
 *                  for their entire operation.
 *
 *                  Readers also use the lock, but only for a minimal
 *                  amount of time-- enough time to grab a pointer to
 *                  the current store, and to increment a reference
 *                  count in that store.  The lock does not need to
 *                  be held when readers exit.
