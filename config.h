/* Our memory management algorithm keeps an array of thread reader
 * epochs that's shared across threads. The basic idea is that each
 * reader writes the current epoch into their slot in the array in
 * order to declare the current epoch as the one they're reading in.
 * Readers will ignore any writes that are from after the epoch, as
 * well as any objects that were retired before or duing this epoch
 * (retirements are essentially deletions, and write operations are
 * always expected to logically happen at the beginning of an epoch).
 *
 * When we go to clean up a record that has been "retired", we
 * essentially need to check whether there are any readers still
 * active in an epoch after the record was created, and before the
 * record was retired. If there is, then we continue to defer
 * deletion.
 *
 * To do this, we have to scan the reservation for every single
 * thread.  It'd be bad to have to resize the reservations, so we'll
 * keep them in static memory, and only allow a fixed number of
 * threads (HATRACK_THREADS_MAX).
