 *  Name:           ballcap.h
 *  Description:    Besides a Lot of Locking, Clearly Awesomely Parallel
 *
 *                  Uses pthread locks on a per-bucket basis, and
 *                  allows multiple simultaneous writers, except when
 *                  performing table migration.
 *
 *                  Also uses our strategy from Lohat to ensure we can
 *                  provide a fully consistent ordered view of the hash
 *                  table.
