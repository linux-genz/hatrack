# Hatrack Documentation

This page contains documentation both for developers wanting to use the hatrack library in their programs, and for people wanting to understand how the algorithms work (since most of them have some degree of novelty vs the state of the art).

This API documentation is limited to algorithms that are both compiled into hatrack by default, and intended for general-purpose use. There are algorithms available primarily for comparative testing and/or instructive purposes.  While you may see these algorithms explicitly turned on in the examples that do algorithm comparisons, we do not document them in the public API documentation.
