/* While we don't explicitly discuss it much in the comments of the
 * algorithms, most of our reads are agnostic to memory ordering.
 *
 * We use this macro whenever it doesn't matter if an update is
 * happening concurrently, we'll take either version.
 *
 * We continue to use atomic_load() if we DO want a memory barier on
 * the read operation, for instance in our debugging support code.

/* Most of our writes will need ordering, except when initializing
 * variables, which isn't worth worrying about.
 *
 * Compare-And-Swap is our workhorse for writing, and by default
 * provides sequentially consistent memory ordering.
 *
 * Note that our LCAS macro keeps tally of whether a CAS succeeds or
 * fails, as per counters.{h,c}.  When HATRACK_COUNTERS is undefined,
 * the extra accounting gets compiled out, and we end up with
 * an atomic_compare_exchange_strong() only.
