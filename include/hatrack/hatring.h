 *  Name:           hatring.h
 *  Description:    A wait-free ring buffer.
 *
 *  Note that, after finishing this, I just searched for other
 *  multi-consumer, multi-producer implementations, and found
 *  something I had not previously seen (I had searched, but nothing
 *  reasonable came up on the top page I guess).  There's a 2015 paper
 *  by Steven Feldman et al. that's worth mentioning.
 *
 *  I might implement their algorithm at some point to compare, and it
 *  takes a similar approach to wait freedom (exponential backoff,
 *  which is a pretty obvious and easy approach, especially when you
 *  can't exponentially grow the storage as with other algorithms).
 *
 *  However, from their paper, the thing that's most surprising to me
 *  is that, for what is allegedly a "ring buffer", enqueues can fail
 *  if a buffer is full.  While I could definitely speed my ring up by
 *  allowing that, it seems like the antithesis of what ring buffers
 *  are for... the newest data should be guaranteed an enqueue slot,
 *  at the expense of dropping older, unread data.
 *
 *  Without that, they haven't produced what I consider a true ring
 *  buffer-- it's just a fixed-sized FIFO.
