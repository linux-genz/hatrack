 *  Name:           helpmanager.h
 *  Description:    Support for data-structure specific announce arrays, for
 *                  supporting wait freedom.
 *
 *                  Our approach to this problem is to fully linearize
 *                  all operations subject to help.  The help manager
 *                  has a master help record that dictates the
 *                  operation we're currently working on. 
 *
 *                  If a thread comes in with work to be done, they
 *                  first work to complete the existing operation. 
 *
 *                  If they find that some thread has signaled for
 *                  help, they will scan the announce array helping
 *                  all requests, before installing theirs.
 *
 *                  If installation fails more than a fixed number of
 *                  times, they enqueue their own help request.
 *
