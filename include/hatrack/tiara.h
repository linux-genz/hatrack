 *  Name:           tiara.h
 *
 *  Description:    This Is A Rediculous Acronym.
 *
 *                  This is roughly in the hihat family, but uses
 *                  64-bit hash values, which we do not generally
 *                  recommend. However, it allows us to show off an
 *                  algorithm that requires only a single
 *                  compare-and-swap per core operation.
 *
 *                  There are a few other differences between this and
 *                  the rest of the hihat family:
 *
 *                  1) We do NOT keep an epoch value.  It would
 *                  require more space, which defeats the purpose.
 *
 *                  2) We still need two status bits, which normally
 *                     we'd steal from the epoch, or, in the lohat
 *                     family, from a pointer to a dynamically
 *                     allocated record.  We've already weakened the
 *                     collision resistance of the hash to an amount
 *                     that I'm not truly comfortable with, so instead
 *                     we steal it from the item field, meaning that
 *                     you CANNOT store integers in here, without
 *                     shifting them up at least two bits.
 *
 *                  We obviously could do a lot better if we could CAS
 *                  more at once, and it's not particularly clear to
 *                  me why modern architectures won't just let you do
 *                  atomic loads and CASs on entire cache lines.
 *
 *                  Unless there's a good reason, hopefully we'll see
 *                  that happen some day!
