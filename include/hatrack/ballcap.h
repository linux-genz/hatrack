 *  Name:           ballcap.h
 *  Description:    Besides a Lot of Locking, Clearly Awesomely Parallel
 *
 *                  Uses pthread locks on a per-bucket basis, and
 *                  allows multiple simultaneous writers, except when
 *                  performing table migration.
 *
 *                  Also uses our strategy from Lohat to ensure we can
 *                  provide a fully consistent ordered view of the hash
 *                  table.
 *
 *                  This table is based on newshat, but changes the
 *                  record structure to use our approach to managing
 *                  record history that we developed for the lohat
 *                  algorithms (including woolhat, which is an
 *                  incremental improvement on lohat, adding wait
 *                  freedom; something a lock-based algorithm can
 *                  never have).
 *
 *                  This hash table is mainly intended to allow us to
 *                  benchmark our lock-free and wait free hash tables
 *                  that use consistent ordering, with a table that
 *                  uses locks, but has the same consistent ordering
 *                  capabilities. And indeed, in my testing so far,
 *                  performance is not appreciably different from the
 *                  lohats (though it's probably better on systems
 *                  without a 128-bit CAS operation).
 *
 *                  That is to say, I don't really expect people to
 *                  consider using this table in real-world
 *                  applications (or patterning a table off of it).
 *
 *                  Given all the above, the implementation of ballcap
 *                  is mostly uncommented; see implementations of
 *                  either newshat or lohat0 for documentation on the
 *                  algorithm.

/*
 * Ballcap is our only locking table with a flag on records to
 * indicate whether or not they're deleted. Everything else relies on
 * an explicit epoch counter that lives in the data structure being
 * set to 0.
 *
 * However, like the lohat family (including woolhat), records are
 * allocated via mmm, and so the epoch field is somewhat transparent
 * to us. We could use a macro to extract it quickly, since it's at a
 * fixed offset, but space is cheap. All of those implementations
 * support a delete field.
 *
 * For the lock-free variants that do not use mmm (and do not provide
 * consistency), we go back to using a 0 epoch to indicate deletion.
