/* refhat_bucket_t
 *
 * For consistency with our other (parallel) implementations, our
 * refhat hash table doesn't move things around the hash table on a
 * deletion.  Instead, it marks buckets as "deleted". If the same key
 * gets reinserted before a table resize, the same bucket will be
 * reused.
 *
 * hv      -- The hash value associated with a bucket, if any.
 *
 * item    -- A pointer to the item being stored in the hash table,
 *            which will generally be a key/value pair in the case
 *            of dictionaries, or just a single value in the case of
 *            sets.
 *
 * deleted -- Set to true if the item has been removed.
 *
 * epoch   -- An indication of insertion time, which we will use to
 *            sort items in the dictionary, when we produce a "view"
 *            (views are intended for iteration or set operations).
 *            The epoch number is chosen relative to other insertions,
 *            and monotonically increases from 1 (see refhat_t below).
 *            If an item is already in the table during a write
 *            operation, where we end up replacing the stored item,
 *            then the value of the epoch field is NOT updated, to
 *            keep insertion order sorting consistent with how Python
 *            does it.
 *
 *            If this value is zero, it indicates there's no item in
 *            the bucket.

/* refhat_t
 *
 * The main type for our reference hash table; it contains any
 * information that persists across a table resize operation
 * (everything else lives in the refhat_bucket_t type).
 * 
 * last_slot --  The array index of the last bucket, so this will be
 *               one less than the total number of buckets. We store
 *               it this way, because we're going to use this value
 *               far more frequently than the total number.
 *
 * threshold --  We use a simple metric to decide when we need to
 *               migrate the hash table buckets to a different set of
 *               buckets-- when an insertion would lead to 75% of the
 *               buckets in the current table being used.  This field
 *               olds 75% of the total table size.  Note that, when
 *               we actually migrate the buckets, the allocated size
 *               could grow, shrink or stay the same, depending on
 *               how many removed items are cluttering up the table.
 *
 * used_count -- Indicates how many buckets in the table have a hash
 *               value associated with it. This includes both items
 *               currently in the table and buckets that are reserved,
 *               because they have a hash value associated with them,
 *               but the item has been removed since the last
 *               resizing.
 *
 * item_count -- The number of items in the table, NOT counting
 *               deletion entries.
 *
 * buckets    -- The current set of refhat_bucket_t objects.
 *
 * next_epoch -- The next epoch value to give to an insertion
 *               operation, for the purposes of sort ordering.

 * alone can stand in for object identity. One might, for instance,
 * choose a 3-universal keyed hash function, or if hash values need to
 * be consistent across runs, something fast and practical like XXH3.
