 *  Name:           counters.h
 *  Description:    In-memory counters for performance monitoring,
 *                  when HATRACK_COUNTERS is on.
 *
 *                  When these are off, no counter-related code will
 *                  be generated. For instance, hatomic.h has
 *                  compare-and-swap wrapper macros that can increment
 *                  a Yes / No counter, based on the result, but if
 *                  HATRACK_COUNTERS is not defined, it just compiles
 *                  down to atomic_compare_exchange_strong().
 *
 *                  When they're on, we still do what we can to
 *                  minimize the performance impact, while keeping
 *                  them atomic, using sequentially consistent updates
 *                  (via atomic_fetch_add()), and keeping them in
 *                  statically allocated memory (though, it would be
 *                  better to keep them in dynamic memory, if it's in
 *                  the same cache line as what we're operating on at
 *                  the time).
 *
 *                  Right now, I'm primarily using these to monitor
 *                  CAS success and fail rates, in lock free
 *                  algorithms. And they do add about 80% overhead,
 *                  since I'm putting these counters in critical
 *                  sections and creating a lot of unnecessary cache
 *                  misses.
 *
 *                  Still, even when monitoring every single CAS and
 *                  more, while performance degrades, almost every
 *                  program under the sun could tolerate keeping these
 *                  on all the time.
