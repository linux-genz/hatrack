 *  Name:           rand.c
 *
 *  Description:    A random number generation API that keeps RNGs
 *                  per-thread to minimize contention.
 *
 *                  Note that this interface isn't particularly high
 *                  level:
 *
 *                  1) You need to do the hashing yourself, and pass in
 *                     the value.
 *
 *                  2) You just pass in a pointer to an "item" that's
 *                     expected to represent the key/item pair.
 *
 *                  3) You need to do your own memory management for
 *                     the key / item pairs, if appropriate.
 *
 *                  Most of the implementation is inlined in the header
 *                  file, since it merely dispatches to individual
 *                  implementations.
 *
 *                  To try to make algorithm comparisons as fair as
 *                  possible, I try to do everything I can to
 *                  eliminate places where the OS might use a mutex,
 *                  where there might be contention among threads.
 *
 *                  Top of that list is malloc() -- where I recommend
 *                  addressing by linking in the hoard malloc
 *                  implementation.
 *
 *                  Second on that list is the random number
 *                  generator, since we use a lot of random numbers in
 *                  our testing, and would like to avoid several
 *                  things:
 *
 *                  1) Calling into the kernel more than we need to
 *                     (e.g., if we were to read from /dev/urandom).
 *
 *                  2) Any locks around RNG APIs.  For instance, I'm
 *                     pretty sure arc4random() has such a lock on my
 *                      machine.
 *
 *                  3) Holding on to too much memory.
 *
 *                  My basic approach is to implement ARC4 ourselves,
 *                  and keep the state on a per-thread basis, with the
 *                  seed xor'd with the bottom byte of the thread's
 *                  pthread id (just to get some variance in the
 *                  number streams; multiple threads can definitely
 *                  end up with identical streams of numbers).  We
 *                  read the seed once, at initialization time, from
 *                  /dev/urandom.
 *
 *                  Note that ARC4 is very broken, cryptographically
 *                  (it was once considered a cryptographic RNG, but
 *                  now certainly is not), but we don't need
 *                  cryptographically strong random numbers for our
 *                  purposes. This just gets the job done with a quick
 *                  algorithm, that can be done without hitting the
 *                  kernel, after initialization.
