/* This epoch system was inspired by my research into what was out
 * there that would be faster and easier to use than hazard
 * pointers. Particularly, IBR (Interval Based Reclaimation) seemed to
 * be about what I was looking for at the time, although since, I've
 * had to adapt it to my needs.
 *
 * In both algorithms, readers commit to an epoch at the time they
 * first enter an "operation". But with my algorithm, writers both
 * commit to a read epoch when they first start reading the data
 * structure, but they don't commit to a "write epoch" until the end
 * of their operation. This is important in our ability to have a
 * linear order for write operations, because writes may not complete
 * in the order they started.
 *
 * When I had the epiphany that I could fully linearize my hash table
 * if the write doesn't "commit" until a specific epoch, and those
 * commits are guaranteed to be ordered by epoch, the challenge was to
 * do this in a way that's atomic.
 *
 * To understand issues that arise, consider the typical (pseudo-)code
 * for setting an allocation epoch:
 *
 * write_epoch = atomic_fetch_and_add(epoch, 1) + 1
 *
 * The extra + 1 here is because a FAA operation returns the original
 * value, not the new epoch.  The write reall should happen on the
 * boundary of the old epoch and the new epoch, if there are are
 * readers looking at that epoch already (since they might have
 * already passsed by our node in their work).
 *
 * Actually, that's not strictly true, because we could force every
 * access, including reads, to create a new epoch.  If, we do this, we
 * are guaranteed that the write's committment epoch will always be
 * unique, and that any nearby readers will therefore see what they
 * should see.
 *
 * However, if we want to reduce memory barriers on the epoch counter
 * (which is desirable), we must consider writes to happen at the END
 * of their epoch, since readers that happened to grab the bumped
 * epoch before we commit our write could theoretically not see that
 * the record was active in their epoch.  That's the approach we take
 * here, especially considering that, typically, most hash table
 * access is done by readers.
 *
 * Another issue we have with the attempt to commit writes to an epic,
 * is that the store into the memory associated with the variable
 * write_epoch is NOT atomic (even without the +1). So the committing
 * thread could get suspended.
 *
 * And, while that thread is suspended, a reader that needs
 * linearization can come along, trying to read from a later epoch,
 * even though our commit hasn't happened yet.
 *
 * Our solution to this problem is to not allow readers to pass a
 * memory record that they see, where there is no epoch
 * committment. Instead, they must try to help, by also creating a
 * "new" epoch, and trying to write it to write_epoch via compare and
 * swap.  Since all readers will do this, and since any CAS failure
 * means some previous CAS succeded, it means this record will have an
 * epoch before any operation tries to process it.
 *
 * To clarify, for the writer inserting into the table, here's what the
 * process looks like:
 *
 * 1) Allocate the record, with no epoch data set.
 *
 * 2) Put it in the place where it belongs in a data structure,
 *    pointing to whatever record it replaces, if it exists.
 *
 * 3) Bump the epoch counter, which will also return the current
 *    epoch, which we again add 1 to, so that our number matches the
 *    epoch we created.
 *
 * 4) Attempt to write the value of the epoch we created into the
 *    write_epoch field, via compare-and-swap.
 *
 * 5) If the compare-and-swap fails, no big deal... it means the write
 *    has a later epoch than the one we were going to give it, but one
 *    more reflective of when the commit finally occured. And, there
 *    is guaranteed linearization before any other thread attempts to read
 *    the value in this record.
 *
 * Note that, as I was working this approach out, I realized there is
 * a fundamental race condition in the IBR approach as-described, that
 * makes it inappropriate for any kind of linearization.  In the
 * simplist version of their algorithm, they have a function
 * start_op() meant for every thread to use when starting a series of
 * reads OR writes to a data structure. Their pseudo-code for this
 * operation is:
 *
 * start_op(): reservations[tid] = epoch
 *
 * As with the above code, the entire operation cannot be done
 * atomically, so far as I'm aware. That means, the following scenario
 * is possible:
 *
 * 1) Our thread runs start_op(), and reads epoch N.
 * 2) Our thread gets SUSPENDED before recording its reservation.
 * 3) In epoch N+1, another thread retires a piece of the data structure
 *     that was alive in epoch N.
 * 4) Since no reservations are currently recorded for epoch N, the
 *    thread deletes the memory it just retired.
 * 5) Our thread wakes back up in epoch N+1, and attempts to read data
 *    that was available in epoch N.
 *
 * Certainly, in this case, we trust the other thread maintained the
 * data structure properly, so that we don't attempt to load a record
 * that's been freed. However, it's clear that we cannot even be
 * guaranteed that a reader who reserves epoch N will be able to
 * access every record that was theoretically alive in epoch N.
 *
 * For our epoch system, we address this problem by forcing the reader
 * to check to make sure the epoch hasn't changed after writing to the
 * array (if it hasn't changed, we are safe).
 *
 * Such a check on its own is not wait-free, because it's possible
 * that, every time we go to look at the epoch, a new write has since
 * occured, ad infinitum. We have two options for "enhancing" this
 * algorithm to make it wait-free:
 *
 * 1) We can recognize that this is probably never going to be a
 *    scenario that's likely to cause significant spinning for the
 *    thread, and specify that no writes are ever allowed under any
 *    circumstances, once the epoch counter gets to its maximum
 *    value. The fact that there's a bounded maximum wait time makes
 *    this algorithm wait-free, even though the bound is exceptionally
 *    high (2^64).
 *
 * 2) We can be conservative, and be willing to pay the performance
 *    penalty to avoid significant spinning in heavy-write
 *    situations. In such a case, we make a small number of attempts
 *    (say, 3), and then ask writers to "help" us, with the following
 *    algorithm:
 *
 *      a) In each item of the "reservations" array, we reserve one
 *         bit of each thread's reservation field as a "HELP" bit.
 *
 *         When a reader hits the maximum retries, he sets his own
 *         HELP bit, and atomically bumps a global "help" counter (with
 *         fetch and add.
 *
 *      b) Writers check the global help counter before every
 *         write. If it's non-zero, then they look at EVERY value in
 *         the reservation array before commencing any write operation
 *         (keeping them from creating a new epoch), looking for the
 *         help bit. If they see the help bit, they attempt to read
 *         the current epoch, and swap it into the reservation field.
 *         Then, the thread also checks against the current epoch,
 *         retrying if the epoch increases.  If the swap succeeds, and
 *         the epoch didn't increase in the process, then the writer
 *         removes 1 from the global help counter.
 *
 *         Once there's a successful epoch reservation, any writer
 *         attempting to help continues to proceed through the array,
 *         until they get to the end of the array, or the help count
 *         becomes zero (whichever occurs first).
 *
 *      c) The reader alternates between two operations:
 *
 *         i) Attempting to read an epoch from the gloval epoch counter.
 *         ii) Reading its reservation bucket (atomically).
 *
 *         If it manages to read an epoch itself, it still has to attempt
 *         to commit it, and test is as before. If it succeeds in helping
 *         itself, it also decrements the help counter.
 *
 *    Swaps in this algorithm should always set the "expected" value to
 *    the "No reservation" value (0), OR'd with the "HELP" bit, which
 *    would be the most significant bit.
 *
 *    It should be easy to see that this algorithm is also wait-free,
 *    bounded by the total number of writer threads. In the worst
 *    case, let's assume there are N writer threads that all start
 *    writing before thread T asks for help.  Any future thread that
 *    comes through with a second write operation, will NOT bump the
 *    epoch until it ensures that thread T got a safe epoch. We could
 *    end up in a situation where all N writer threads are helping T
 *    get a safe epoch-- in such a case, no thread can possibly be
 *    incrementing the epoch counter, bounding the work to O(N), thus
 *    making the algorithm wait-free.
 *
 * The first algorithm should be more performant in the expected case,
 * since checking a "help" counter will generally be a waste. If we
 * want to make the second algorithm even less likely to fire, we can
 * use a "deferred help" strategy, where writers only help if help is
 * still needed when a thread goes through the reclaimation process.
 *
 *
 * In the below enumeration:
 *
 * The first value will be stored in the reservations array when
 * threads do not have an epoch they've reserved for reading.
 *
 * The second is the first value of the epoch counter, which is 1.
 * There will never be any data in this epoch (any writer would bump
 * the epoch as part of their commit process).
 *
 * The third value is if we choose to implement the algorithm above to
 * help with epoch acquisitions -- it's the value that readers put
 * into their reservation to signal for help. This does reduce the
 * space for the epoch counter to 63 bits, which is still vastly more
 * epochs than any program could ever use in practice (using 1B epochs
 * per second, we'd have enough epochs for almost 300 years).
 *
 * The final value is used when we're looking to free old records. We
 * initialize the maximum value seen to this value, then go through
 * the reservations array, reducing the maximum value seen as we go
 * along.  If it's still this value by the time we get to the end,
 * then we can delete all our records.

/* mmm_start_linearized_op() is used to help ensure we can safely recover
 * a consistent, full ordering of data objects in the lohat family.
 *
 * 1) When getting a read epoch that needs to be fully ordered, we
 *    make a reservation. But, we can't rely on that reservation alone
 *    for linearization. Particularly, if we're very slow to write our
 *    reservation to the reservations array, items could get retired
 *    in the same epoch, and freed, all before we complete our
 *    reservation (if the epoch advances while we're suspended, for
 *    instance).
 *
 *    That is, once the reservation is in place, it ensures nothing
 *    that's still in the table from that epoch or later is
 *    removed. However, this race condition means that it does not
 *    ensure that nothing EVER alive in that epoch won't be removed.
 *
 *    Checking the reservation again will give us a useful upper
 *    bound. We know that nothing retired from that epoch on will be
 *    freed before we're done with our linearization operation.  But,
 *    there might be a write operation in the current epoch, and that
 *    operation might actually end up delayed.
 *
 *    However! We have a restriction that there can be at most ONE
 *    write per epoch.  Therefore, we can go ahead and use this epoch
 *    to linearize. Either we will see the new write, in which case
 *    our linearization point is conceptionally the instant after the
 *    write (but before any retires), or we won't see the new write,
 *    in which case our linearization point is effectively the very
 *    end of the previous epoch, after any retires.
 *
 *    Even if there were retires in this new epoch, it won't matter;
 *    retires in the same epoch of creation never happen, since the
 *    writer reserves an epoch equal to or previous to that epoch, and
 *    creates a new epoch at the end.  And, by this point, we will
 *    have a reservation in the table, so writers in future epochs
 *    won't free from underneath us either.
 *
 *    When full ordering is necessary, readers should use the function
 *    mmm_start_linearized_op(), instead of mmm_start_op().  They do
 *    still use mmm_end_op() to end their operation and give up their
 *    reservation.
 *
 * 2) Whenever the reader finds a record w/ no write epoch, it must
 *    try to help get the record a definitive epoch before proceeding.
 *    If the stalled thread beats the linearized reader, we will see
 *    an epoch lower than ours, and will then read the
 *    record. Otherwise, the record write epoch will be higher than
 *    our read epoch, and we will not read. As part of our helping, we
 *    bump the write epoch, as all writes must occur on an epoch
 *    boundary, with only one write per epoch.
