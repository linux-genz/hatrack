 *  Name:           oldhat.h
 *  Description:    Half-Interesting HAsh Table w/ single-word CAS only.
 *
 *                  This is somewhat like hihat1, except that we do
 *                  not use a double-word Compare-And-Swap, as it is
 *                  not natively available on all architectures (C11
 *                  atomics imitate this with locks, if not available,
 *                  but may warn about slow performance).
 *
 *                  This constraint does lead to some real differences
 *                  in the algorithm, particularly:
 *
 *               1) Since we can't swap in a record consisting of two
 *                  64-bit values (one value being an item, and the
 *                  other being an epoch and flags), we instead swap
 *                  in a pointer to a record.
 *
 *                  We use mmm to allocate these records, and use the
 *                  global mmm "epoch" value for the epoch value,
 *                  which gets placed in a hidden mmm header (see
 *                  mmm.h and mmm.c).  And, we then steal bits from
 *                  the pointer to the record to track status (see
 *                  the flag enumeration below).
 *
 *                  This, of course, means that we need to worry about
 *                  memory management of these records, now.
 *
 *               2) We need to handle hash comparisons differently. We
 *                  can either assume that 64 bits of hash value is
 *                  enough for identity, in which case, we only use
 *                  the first 64 bits of any hatrack_hash_t passed in,
 *                  or we write out the hash value in two chunks.
 *
 *
 *                  Beyond those items, the algorithms are otherwise
 *                  similar.  In our comments, we try to limit
 *                  ourselves to the differences between the
 *                  algorithms, so it is good to start with hihat1
 *                  before attempting to wrap your head around this
 *                  version.
