 *  Name:           hq.c
 *  Description:    A fast, wait-free queue implementation.
 *
 * This is mainly an array we use in a ring, until the head grows to
 * meet the tail, at which point we double the size of the store,
 * copying data over.
 *
 * The hardest bit is keeping a linearized ordering intact during this
 * migration operation.
 *
 * If some active enqueues have to wait until after the migration,
 * that's no problem; the threads in the middle of their operations
 * can complete in any order without any of them being able to detect
 * it.
 *
 * We don't have the same luxury on the dequeue side.  For example,
 * imagine we're resizing a queue of size four, that contains: 
 *
 *    [0, 1, 2, 3]
 *
 * If the migration begins in parallel with three dequeuers of various
 * speeds, we might end up having 2 dequeue before 0 and 1.  That in
 * and of itself isn't a problem, as we can consider the linearization
 * point when we handed out the address from which to dequeue-- as
 * long as the three threads each dequeue their item, then all is
 * good; the operations can be linearized, and we just act like the
 * threads just took different speeds to return, conceptually.
 *
 * However, if we pause dequeuers in order to migrate, and then we
 * restart the operation, it would certainly be possible for the
 * thread that dequeued 2 to dequeue 0 or 1, which would violate our
 * linearization.
 *
 * Dequeuers can notice there's a dequeue in progress in two
 * ways. First, they might see it when they're trying to load an index
 * to store into. But, if they miss that signal, they might see it in
 * the cell when they try to read, or to mark the cell as read.
 *
 * If they don't notice the dequeue at all, the threads on either side
 * of them might be slower.  To ensure linearization, we would at
 * least need to make sure that any thread that theoretically dequeues
 * before us finishes its dequeue, even if it's out of the new store.
 *
 * Note also that various threads helping in the migration could end
 * up seeing different values of the various pointers, as late FAAs
 * process.
 *
 * Since different threads might have slightly different views on
 * where the start and end of the list are, we need to make sure we
 * don't get confused.  We don't want to miss copying items or
 * accidentally allow items to be dequeued twice, once in each store.
 *
 * To be clear, what we want to accomplish is to move a contiguous
 * block of cells, ending at what is the head at the time the
 * migration completes that have been enqueued (or skipped; writers
 * are allowed to skip cells, in which case the epoch in the cell will
 * be older than the tail), but have NOT been dequeued.  Once we find
 * ANY dequeued item, we must assume every item with an epoch lower
 * than it is in the process of being dequeued, and NOT migrate it.
 *
 * And, if *we* are a dequeuer who noticed the need to migrate, but
 * not until we were assigned a slot, then we will complete our
 * operation out of the OLD store if it turns out that our index ends
 * up LOWER than something that got dequeued (but only after the
 * migration is finished).  Otherwise, we will re-start the operation
 * in the new store.
 *
 * Once we mark a cell for migration, no other cell will change the
 * status of whether the cell is queued or enqueued, until after the
 * migration is complete.  So, we can simply rush to mark all the
 * cells, while keeping note of the highest epoch found in any cell.
 *
 * Once we have marked all cells, we go to the cell w/ the highest
 * epoch, and scan until we've either scanned all cells, or until we
 * find a cell that has been dequeued.  
 *
 * Remember again that cells can be skipped by the enqueue operation,
 * in which case the scan will show epochs that are lower than the
 * lowest possible epoch.  Those cells get marked as 'moved', since
 * there is no work to do to them.
 *
 * Once we find the starting point for the migration, we do all the
 * typical copying that we'd do in most of our other algorithms. Then,
 * any threads who had pending dequeue operations need to check the
 * epoch they were given; if it's below the starting point, we
 * complete the dequeue out of the old store. Otherwise, we pretend
 * like we never got a number assigned, and try again out of the new
 * store.
 *
 * As a result of the algorithm, our API for the migration is a little
 * bit different than most of our other migrations.  hq_migrate()
 * doesn't return the new store, it instead returns the smallest
 * migrated epoch, so that dequeuers know whether or not to resume.
 *
 * Threads needing to redo in the new store, just re-acquire the store
 * via the top-level object pointer.
