 *  Name:           stack.c
 *  Description:    A faster stack implementation that avoids
 *                  using a linked list node for each item.
 *
 *                  Note that, if pops start, and have a push start
 *                  before the pop completes, or an pop end before us,
 *                  the stack can temporarily end up with dead
 *                  space... popped items below the head of the stack.
 *                  Pops therefore need to take dead space into
 *                  account, and walk down the stack when they see it,
 *                  until they find something to pop.
 * 
 *                  Note that I originally had the ability to do
 *                  as-you-go compression if a reader ends up walking
 *                  too far down to pop, and new pushes come in ahead
 *                  of him.  I was surprised to find that, even with a
 *                  high pusher to popper ratio, this is sigificantly
 *                  faster if we just wait to compress out popped
 *                  cells until we run out of space in the array.
 *
 *                  What ended up happening was multiple "gaps" that
 *                  could be compressed would show up in parallel, and
 *                  I'd only compress the top one.  So I was making
 *                  more threads do more work because compression is
 *                  more complicated, while only modestly lowering the
 *                  number of migrations I'd ultimately have to do.
 *
 *                  So instead of only compressing the top of the
 *                  stack, and doing it relatively frequently, I now
 *                  just wait till you run out of space, and then
 *                  compress the whole thing.
 *
 *                  I could use the compression algorithm I was using
 *                  for this, but instead I do the following:
 *
 *                  1) If, after compression, the stack would be more
 *                     than 1/2 full, I double the size of the stack,
 *                     and compress into the new store, using the same
 *                     algorithm I use for migrating hash tables.
 *
 *                  2) If, after compression, the stack would be 1/2
 *                     full or less, instead of compressing in place,
 *                     I create a new store of the same size, and 
 *                     compress into that.
 *
 *                  When we don't NEED to grow, we could definitely
 *                  avoid another memory allocation, and possibly some
 *                  copying.  However, I am pretty sure the extra
 *                  effort to coordinate an in-place compression isn't
 *                  worth it; better just to copy.  I may test this at
 *                  some point.
 *
 *                  In the meantime, I have stashed away a version
 *                  that does in-place compression so I can re-visit
 *                  it later.
 *
 *                  Currently, this algorithm is lock-free; Pushes
 *                  might need to retry if a pop invalidates their
 *                  cell, and that could happen continually.
 *
 *                  We could easily address this with a "help"
 *                  facility that keeps pops from asking pushes to
 *                  retry (and thus from moving the head pointer when
 *                  done), which risks increasing compressions.  We'll
 *                  try that out soon.
