/* refhat_init()
 *
 * It's expected that refhat instances will be created via the default
 * malloc.  This function cannot rely on zero-initialization of its
 * own object, though it does zero-initialize the buckets it allocates
 * (also with the default memory allocator).
 *
 * For the definition of HATRACK_MIN_SIZE, this is computed in
 * config.h, since we require hash table buckets to always be sized to
 * a power of two. To set the size, you instead set the preprocessor
 * variable HATRACK_MIN_SIZE_LOG.
 *
 * Note that next_epoch starts out as 1, because a 0 value indicates
 * deletion.

    self->used_count = 0;
    self->item_count = 0;

/* refhat_get()
 *
 * Looks up the item associated with the passed hash value, returning
 * it, if appropriate. If not, NULL will be returned. If an address is
 * passed in the found parameter, then the value will be set based on
 * whether the item was found in the table. That allows for items to
 * be of arbitrary types. Without this parameter, we'd have to
 * restrict items to pointer types, so that the return value could
 * indicate not-found.  Nonetheless, if you ARE keeping only pointer
 * types, you can safely pass NULL to the found parameter, and only
 * check the return value.
 *
 * With all of our hashtable implementations, we do linear probing to
 * deal with hash collisions.  We keep the table size to a power of
 * two, so that we can wrap around using a bitwise AND (with one minus
 * the table size), as opposed to doing a mod operation, as the mod
 * operation is usually significantly more expensive.
 *
 * We could save a few operaitons by searching only from the initial
 * hashed index (bix) to self->last_slot, and then if that fails,
 * search from index 0 to bix-1. But, that greatly increases the
 * number of lines of code, and make it brittle to changes. Plus, in
 * my initial testing didn't make more than a 2-3% difference in
 * performance, if that.
 *
 * So for now, we'll skip that optimization.
 *
 * Note that there are a few items that we use (as does every other
 * hash table), including:
 *
 * hatrack_hash_t -- A representation of a hash value, as two 64-bit
 *                   words. We use 128-bit hash values to effectively
 *                   eliminate collisions, if good hash functions are
 *                   selected.
 *
 * hatrack_view_t -- A data type that provides all items in the hash
 *                   table (usually at a given moment in time), in
 *                   insertion order, if requested (returned from
 *                   the hashtable_view() function).
 *
 * Functions to examine and compare hash values, to calculate the
 * initial bucket to use, given a hash value, etc. These functions
 * should be self-explainatory for the most part, but see
 * hatrack_common.h for definitions, if needed.
