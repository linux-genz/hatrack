 *  Name:           debug.h
 *  Description:    Provides support that I've found useful for dealing with
 *                  multi-threaded operations.  Right now, this consists
 *                  of some custom assertion macros, and an in-memory ring
 *                  buffer.
 *
 *                  None of this code is used unless HATRACK_DEBUG is on.
 *
 *                  This code is less concise and elegent than it
 *                  could be: for instance, if we were to use sprintf()
 *                  instead of manually formatting strings.
 *
 *                  However, given the frequency at which this code
 *                  can get called, using sprintf() has a HUGE
 *                  negative impact on performance.
 *
 *                  So yes, I've forgone clarity for performance, all
 *                  to try to make it easier to debug busy
 *                  multi-threaded apps, without having too
 *                  detrimental an impact to performance.
