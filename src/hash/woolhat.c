 *  Description:    Linearizeable, Ordered, Wait-free HAsh Table (WOOLHAT)
 *                  This version never orders, it just sorts when needed.
 *                  Views are fully consistent.
 *
 *                  Note that this table is similar to lohat, but with
 *                  a few changes to make it wait-free. We're going to
 *                  focus comments on those changes; see lohat source
 *                  code for more detail on the overall algorithm.

/* woolhat_set_cleanup_func()
 *
 * If this is set, we will add the associated function as a handler
 * for when we allocate records via MMM (though not stores).
 *
 * This allows our set implementation to determine when items in the
 * set cannot again be accessed through the woolhat API, allowing us
 * to notify the caller that the hash table is totally done with the
 * item in question (unless re-inserted, of course).
 *
 * That's useful for cases where the set conceptually show "own"
 * memory management of the items contained in it.
 *
 * Such cases are very application-dependent of course.
 *
 * Note that it does not make quite as much sense to have witchhat
 * notify when an item is officially removed from the table, because
 * witchhat does not use mmm on its records, so it does not know in a
 * timely manner when all threads that might be looking at the record
 * are done with the record.
 *
 * We could address that by adding a mmm cleanup callback on stores
 * that triggers a user-callback on every item ejected since the last
 * store migration, but that doesn't seem appropriate.
 *
 * Instead, we made the appropriate 'store' functions non-static so
 * that implementations can use mmm themselves, and apply mmm on the
 * items they store.  See the implementation of hatrack_dict (dict.c)
 * for more detail on what we do there.

     * write again, it has to participate in the next migration.
     *
     * Now, if we only ever doubled the size of the table, this
     * operation would be wait-free, because there's an upper bound on
     * the number of table resizes that would happen. However, table
     * sizes can shrink, or stay the same. So a workload that clutters
     * up a table with lots of deleted items could theoretically leave
     * a thread waiting indefinitely.
     *
     * This case isn't very practical in the real world, but we can
     * still guard against it, with nearly zero cost. Our approach is
     * to count the number of attempts we make to mutate the table
     * that result in a resizing, and when we hit a particular
     * threshold, we "ask for help". When a thread needs help writing
     * in the face of migrations, it means that no thread that comes
     * along to migrate after the request is registered will migrate
     * to a same-size or smaller table. It FORCES the table size to
     * double on a migration, giving us a small bound of how long we
     * might wait.
     *
     * Once the resquest is satisfied, we deregister our request for
     * help.
     *
     * With all my initial test cases, which are mainly write-heavy
     * workloads, if setting the threshold to 8, this help mechanism

        /* When threads need help in the face of a resize, this is
         * where we provide that help.  We do it simply by forcing
         * the table to resize up, when help is required.
         *
         * Note that different threads might end up producing
         * different store sizes, if their value of top->help_needed
         * changes.  This is ultimately irrelevent, because whichever
         * store we swap in will be big enough to handle the
         * migration.
         *
         * Plus, the helper isn't the one responsible for
         * determining when help is no longer necessary, so if the
         * smaller store is selected, the next resize will definitely
         * be bigger, if help was needed continuously.
         *
         * This mechanism is, in practice, the only mechanism that
         * seems like it might have any sort of impact on the overall
         * performance of the algorithm, and if it does have an
         * impact, it seems to be completely in the noise.
